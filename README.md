# TimeLayers
Time Layers is my Team project for Mixed Reality course at Northeastern University. Time Layers is an 3D Unity application that allows users to see a model pass through fictional time periods to experience the past, present, and future in virtual reality.

Physical spaces are reconstructed across three different timelines:
- 🦴 **The Past** - Stone Age aesthetics inspired by The Flintstones
- 🏛️ **The Present** - Your familiar environment as it is today
- 🚀 **The Future** - A futuristic vision inspired by The Jetsons

## 💡 The Inspiration

Remember those classic cartoons that played with time?
- **The Flintstones** 🦕 - Stone Age charm
- **Time Squad** ⏳ - Time-traveling adventures  
- **The Jetsons** 🛸 - Retro-futuristic dreams

We wanted to capture that same whimsical, playful spirit while pushing our technical skills to create something nostalgic and immersive.
